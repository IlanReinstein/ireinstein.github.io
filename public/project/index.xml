      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of the projects I am most proud of. It was a tremendously hard journey, with lots of obstacles, both technical and conceptual, which lead to a constant reformulation of our initial problem. Despite all the difficulties, we managed to build a relatively simple model that now needs to be tested on further studies and prototypes about learning curves. This is the project that got me started with Hierarchical Models and Bayesian Statistics. Even though we did not develop a full Bayesian model for this occasion, I was constantly learning new things about regression and multilevel models, which naturally takes you into the Bayesian world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in education, adaptive learning algorithms and the potential applications of multilevel models in this type of setting, then I&amp;rsquo;m sure this paper will be quite enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not hesitate to reach out with an questions you may have about this, I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to discuss more.&lt;/p&gt;
