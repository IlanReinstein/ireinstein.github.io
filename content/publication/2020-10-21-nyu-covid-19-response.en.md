summary: "The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged front-line clinical decision-making, leading to numerous published prognostic tools. Here, we use retrospective and prospective hospitalizations to develop and validate a parsimonious model to identify patients with favorable outcomes, based on real-time lab values, vital signs, and oxygen support variables."

As one of many of NYU Langone's data scientists, I got to collaborate with the wonderful team from the Predictive Analytics Unit from NYU's Medical Center to develop a model capable of predicting which patients will have favorable outcomes after being hospitalized. These were intense weeks not only at NYU and I am proud of being able to contribute to this project and help our physicians during these challenging times.
