I am a data scientist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, primarily focused on medical education research and learning analytics. I apply different statistical methods to various questions around education quality and educational outcomes. I also collaborate with other teams as a data consultant to solve problems on data collection and processing, data visualization, and report automation.

I enjoy solving problems from various sectors using data, statistics, and machine learning.
