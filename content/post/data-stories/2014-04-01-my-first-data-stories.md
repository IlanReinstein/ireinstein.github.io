This post is simply to display and promote some of my early projects in analytics and data visualization. The topics are diverse, ranging from sports to energy economics. These are simply some exploratory and visual analyses I performed in 2014 when trying to promote our product. The purpose of these posts was to educate businesses on the potential of data-driven decisions as well as showcase and expose our data products and solutions.

I am very fond of these small projects as it was my first experience using R and performing data analytics and visualization, thus encouraging me to pursue a career in data science.Â I hope you enjoy the read and the insight. I will try to produce newer posts in the near future.
