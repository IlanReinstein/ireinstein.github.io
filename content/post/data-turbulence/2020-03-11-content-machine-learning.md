As part of my journey in Statistics and Machine Learning, I was fortunate enough to write original content about popular libraries, algorithms and software packages used in this line of work. This content was all developed during the time I worked with KDnuggets, a site that is widely recognized for its contributions on content about recent advances in the field of Big Data and Predictive Analytics.

You may visit the site and my contributions on this [link](https://www.kdnuggets.com/author/ilan-reinstein).

I hope you enjoy it!
